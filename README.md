`oneterminal` empowers you to craft modern CLI terminals tailored to your company's unique needs. Serving a diverse range of industries, it streamlines the process of creating everything from basic CLI apps with a few flags to advanced terminals with root (driver), groups, sub-commands, arguments, and options.

> ***Take your app to the command line, supporting Unicode, and create modern terminals in any user language.***

### **Features**:
- Design and configure your terminal apps leveraging microservices architecture, Dependency Injection (DI), and the options pattern.
- Choose our built-in features or build your solutions for terminal UX, input parsing, error responses, command checks, data storage, and robust type verification.
- Use in-memory implementation for high-performance command storage or remote storage solutions, tailored for environments like Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.
- Craft deployment-agnostic CLI terminals with all necessary dependencies, evaluate them in local setups, and roll them out on-premise, on the cloud (public, private, or government), or in hybrid settings.
- Establish enterprise-level secure CLI or terminal applications for your offerings, similar to [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli), or other CLI terminals with tailored formats.
- Participate in our open-source community, help resolve issues, and share feedback on features and documentation.
- Try our [demo license](https://docs.perpetualintelligence.com/articles/pi-demo/intro.html) for quick onboarding, evaluating, and testing our ready samples on GitHub without signing up.

The framework manages the complexities of the infrastructure, making it easier for you to create your CLI apps. Use our [templates](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/docs/tree/main/samples/templates/pi-cli) and [tutorials](https://github.com/perpetualintelligence/docs/tree/main/samples/tutorials/pi-cli) for a fast setup.  

> ***In summary, if your feature works with the .NET ecosystem, oneterminal can turn it into a CLI.***
