# pi-cli
`pi-cli` is the cross-platform developer framework for building all your CLI terminals or command-line systems in the .NET ecosystem. The framework makes it easy to build CLIs for your company, product, service, SaaS, or development and testing needs. Enterprises can create CLIs with few flags or advanced complex CLIs with organization commands, grouped commands, subcommands, arguments, and options.

***Take your app or service to the command line with Unicode support and build your front-end CLI in any language.***

We crafted the `pi-cli` framework to be cross-platform, hosting and deployment agnostic, and fully customizable. We strongly believe .NET provides a rich set of [DSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/about-domain-specific-languages?view=vs-2022) and [DDD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/ddd-oriented-microservice) tools and languages, and `pi-cli` directly supports the .NET (traditional), .NET core, ASP.NET Core, and NET6+ framework. Thus it is naturally the defacto standard in developing cross-platform CLI systems for your apps, services, and developer tools in the entire .NET ecosystem. It lets enterprises build ground-up CLI terminals or migrate their existing CLI apps and terminals with the modern and scalable micro-services-based architecture. 

Use .NET Core, dependency injection, and options pattern to build a modern and secured CLI applications similar to [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/), [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), or CLI terminals with custom formats. Configure your server, provide your self-hosting implementations for stores and host in an environment of your choice, e.g., Windows, Linux, MacOS, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.

***In short, if what you want to achieve is doable in the .NET ecosystem, it is possible with `pi-cli`.***
