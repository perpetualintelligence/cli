# OneImlx.Terminal.Authentication

***Open. Flexible. Cross-Platform. Secured***

> **The most flexible cross-platform framework for building modern and secured CLI and terminal apps.**

`OneImlx.Terminal.Authentication` extends the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework, offering functionalities to develop enterprise-grade, secure CLI and terminal applications. This package emphasizes a secure, zero-trust architecture and compliance with OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards.

> **Note:**  This is a ***preview*** release. Features and implementations are subject to change.

## MSAL Support
Currently, we are integrating [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/msal-overview) as the authentication provider.

> We are considering the addition of support for other Identity Providers (IdPs) beyond MSAL.
