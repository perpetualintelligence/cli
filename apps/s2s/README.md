# Introduction

This sample code is designed for developers implementing service-to-service communication using the `OneImlx.Terminal` framework. It covers the setup and operation of a Test Server and Test Client, demonstrating the framework's capabilities in handling networked command execution via TCP and UDP protocols.

## Overview

**Test Server**: Acts as the receiver and processor of commands. It can be configured in different modes (TCP, UDP, or Console) to accommodate various communication strategies.

**Test Client**: Sends commands to the Test Server using the console router, allowing developers to issue manual commands and observe service-to-service communication. This manual setup is ideal for development and testing phases. In real applications, both client and server can be implemented as automated services that detect service availability over the network and send commands accordingly.

## Configuration and Setup

### Test Server Setup

- **Modes of Operation**:
  - **Console Mode**: For direct interaction via command console.
  - **TCP Mode**: For reliable, connection-oriented network communication.
  - **UDP Mode**: For faster, connectionless network communication.

- **Configuration**: Server settings are managed through an `appsettings.json` file, which includes parameters like IP, port, and operational mode.

- **Logging**: Utilizes `Serilog` for logging, with outputs configured to the console for easy monitoring.

### Test Client Setup

- Configured to align with the Test Server's network settings and operational mode.
- Sends a series of predefined commands to the server.

>NOTE: The client uses a console router for issuing manual commands during testing. This helps developers understand and verify service-to-service communication in real-time. For automated operations, the client and server can both be automated to handle dynamic network scenarios without manual intervention.

## Testing and Validation

### Starting the Applications

Configure the startup projects in the solution to launch both the Test Server and Test Client applications.

1. **Test Server**:
   - Ensure the server configuration aligns with the desired testing mode and network settings.
   - Start the server application to initiate the listening process for incoming commands.

2. **Test Client**:
   - Configure to ensure compatibility with the server's settings.
   - Start the client to begin sending commands to the server manually over TCP or UDP.

## Test Execution

- **Monitor Outputs**: Watch both the server and client consoles for output to confirm that commands are received and processed correctly.
- **Check Connectivity**: For TCP and UDP modes, verify network connectivity and ensure that ports and IP addresses are correctly configured.

## Troubleshooting

- Look for error messages in the console outputs of both server and client.
- Use network monitoring tools to trace and inspect packet flows if necessary.

## Best Practices

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in both server and client to manage and log exceptions effectively.
- **Security**: Ensure secure transmission, especially when using TCP or UDP modes, by considering encryption or secure channels.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the system's performance and optimize as needed to handle expected loads.

## Conclusion

The `OneImlx.Terminal` framework for service-to-service communication provides a robust and flexible platform for developing networked applications. This guide assists developers in setting up, testing, and validating their implementations, ensuring efficient and reliable command handling between services.
